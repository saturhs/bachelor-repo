# Dairy Farm Management Thesis Project - Context Summary

## Project Overview
We are working on a bachelor's thesis project about a dairy farm management system focused on reproductive cycle management. The system is built using Next.js with TypeScript, MongoDB for the database, and Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI for the frontend.

### Thesis Structure Reference
The complete thesis structure is defined in `thesis-structure.md`, which outlines all chapters and sections needed for the final document.

### Core Application Files
- `/my-dairy-farm/src/app/api/animal-events/route.ts` - Contains the core event handling logic
- `/my-dairy-farm/src/components/ui/CalendarView.tsx` - Calendar implementation for event visualization
- `/my-dairy-farm/src/lib/db/models/Event.ts` - Event data model
- `/my-dairy-farm/src/lib/db/models/Animal.ts` - Animal data model
- `/my-dairy-farm/src/lib/db/models/CustomEventType.ts` - Custom event type model
- `/my-dairy-farm/src/app/api/statistics` - Statistical analysis endpoints

## Current Focus and Next Steps

### Currently Completed
We've completed Chapter 7 (Event Scheduling System) of the thesis, ensuring that code examples match the actual implementation in the project files.

### Next to Work On
According to the thesis structure, the next chapter to work on is **Chapter 8: System Functionality**, which should cover:

1. Animal management features
   - Registration and tracking
   - Filtering and categorization
   - Action buttons and status management

2. Calendar view implementation
   - Monthly view design
   - Event filtering and display
   - Day detail view with location grouping
   - Workload visualization

3. Settings and configuration options
   - Custom event type management
   - System parameter configuration
   - Data export capabilities

4. Statistical analysis and reporting features
   - Conception rate visualization
   - Pregnancy distribution analysis
   - Calving distribution throughout the year

After Chapter 8, we'll need to work on:
- Chapter 9: Testing and Validation
- Chapter 10: Results and Discussion
- Chapter 11: Conclusions
- Chapter 12: Future Work

## Key Code References

### Event Model Schema
```typescript
const EventSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  eventType: { type: String, required: true },
  animalId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Animal', required: true },
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  // ...other fields
  status: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    enum: ['Pending', 'Completed', 'Overdue', 'Cancelled'],
    default: 'Pending',
  },
  // ...more fields
});
```

### Event Handler Example
```typescript
async function handleHeatSymptoms(animalId: string, animal: any, notes?: string) {
  // 1. Check if animal is female
  // 2. Record heat observation as completed event
  // 3. Update animal's reproductive status
  // 4. Schedule insemination event
  // 5. Return success details
}
```

### Calendar Functionality
```typescript
// Get unique animal IDs for a location's events
const getAnimalIdsForLocation = (location: string) => {
  const events = getEventsForLocation(location);
  return Array.from(new Set(events.map(event => event.animalId)));
};

// Group events by animal ID
const groupEventsByAnimal = (events: Event[]) => {
  const grouped: Record<string, Event[]> = {};
  // ...grouping logic
  return grouped;
};
```

### Statistical Analysis
```typescript
// Conception Rate Analysis (from statistics/conception-rate/route.ts)
// Calculates pregnancy check success rates over time
// Groups by month and returns formatted data for visualization
```

## Implementation Approach
- Using real code from the project files for all thesis code examples
- Following a flat component structure in the codebase
- Using Next.js App Router for routing and API endpoints
- Implementing reproductive cycle as a state machine
- Using MongoDB for data persistence
- Focusing on practical implementation details in the thesis

## Recommendations
When returning to this context:
- Continue ensuring code examples match actual implementation
- Provide file paths for all code examples
- Use real implementation code rather than theoretical examples
- Focus on unique aspects of each system component
- Reference actual components from the project when describing features
- Maintain consistent style and terminology throughout the thesis
