# GitHub Copilot Edits Chat History

## Animal and Event Model Specifications Development

### Initial Query About Animal Model Specifications
**User**: What do you mean by outlining it?

**Copilot**: When the document says "This document outlines the agreed specifications," it means this markdown file provides a structured overview or summary of the key specifications for the Animal model. 

"Outlining" in this context refers to presenting the main structure and components of the Animal model in an organized way, including:

1. The core fields with their types and validation rules
2. Display requirements for the AnimalCard component
3. Data validation rules to be implemented
4. Implementation notes for developers

Rather than being a detailed implementation guide, this document serves as a reference that summarizes the agreed-upon specifications that should be followed when implementing the Animal model throughout the application.

### Adding Age Category Field
**User**: Okay, I forgot to add a field that represents age, I mean if it's adult or a calf

**Copilot**: I see that you actually already have a field for this purpose in your specification. In the Core Fields table, there's a `category` field:

```
| category | String | Age category | Enum: `adult`, `baby` | `adult` |
```

Would you like to modify this field to use "calf" instead of "baby" since this is a dairy farm application? I can update that for you.

*[Copilot suggested the change from "baby" to "calf" in the category field]*

### Adding Last Heat Day Field
**User**: Okay, I forgot also about lastHeatDay field that will be useful for setting up events in future

**Copilot**: *[Added the lastHeatDay field to the Core Fields table]*

### Events Model Overview
**User**: Since we did a plan for animal model, we need to make a plan for events model as well. I prepared a little overview on this concept. Remember that this is only an example, and for example database model fields should be adjusted for purposes of this specific app...

*[User provided a detailed overview of event reminder system requirements]*

**Copilot**: *[Provided a comprehensive event model specification document]*

### Preserving Conversation Context
**User**: Okay, for now I'd like to end work on project, I'll come back tomorrow, but don't want to lose our conversation, there's too much of context. Is there any way to keep it?

**Copilot**: You can preserve our conversation in a few ways:

1. If you're using GitHub Copilot Chat in VSCode, the history of your conversations should be saved automatically in the left sidebar under the chat history.

2. You can also copy-paste the important parts of our conversation into a Markdown file in your project directory for future reference. For example:

```
c:\Users\saturhs\Desktop\bachelor\bachelor-repo\notes\model-specifications-discussion.md
```

3. If you're using GitHub Copilot in the browser, you may want to bookmark this page or export the conversation before closing it.

The two specification files we've worked on (animal-model-specifications.md and event-model-specifications.md) are already saved in your project directory, so the actual design documents are preserved.

When you're ready to continue working tomorrow, you can simply refer back to these specifications and continue building your application.

**User**: I'm using GitHub Copilot Edits, is there a way? Because I can't find history of chats there

**Copilot**: GitHub Copilot Edits doesn't currently have a built-in conversation history feature like GitHub Copilot Chat does. To preserve our conversation and context, I recommend creating a dedicated notes file in your project:

*[Copilot suggested creating a development journal file]*

**User**: Could you save our messages from this chat into copilot-edits-chat-history.md? As you said you can

**Copilot**: *[Saved the conversation history to this file]*

### Workflow Implementation Details
**User**: I've removed name field from animal model cos its not used on a farm in real life. Also I see that u need more context how the user would use the app. So heres the work flow of the user. Zootechnicians at first would need to add all animals they have on a farm, specifying all required informations, like location. Then they would go to check on animals, when they ffinish for example health check on one of them they can press a button on examined animal "Health check done", then application will automatically add an event for 2 weeks later, for another health check. So 2 weeks later, zootechnician should see in calendar that today they need to check health on this animal. The same when they see heat/estrus symptoms, they would press button "Note heat symptoms", then application would automatically set a reminder for 12 hours later. When they would inseminate the animal they would note that information somehow, so app can set an event to check it after 30 days for pregnancy symptoms, etc etc. For now i want to implement two events in this way: healthCheck that should be repeated every two weeks, estrus/heat that should remind 12h later to inseminate and last pregnancy check that should be reminded every 30 days after insemination. Can we do that?

**Copilot**: 
Based on your workflow description, I've made the following updates:

1. **Animal Model**:
   - Added `lastInseminationDate` field to track when insemination was performed
   - Confirmed removal of the `name` field as it's not used in real farms

2. **Event Model**:
   - Added detailed workflow implementation section explaining the three key workflows:
     - Health Check Workflow (repeating every 2 weeks)
     - Heat/Estrus to Insemination Workflow (12-hour trigger)
     - Pregnancy Check Workflow (30 days after insemination)
   - For each workflow, detailed:
     - Initial setup
     - Completion flow
     - Required UI components

3. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Added specifics about button-based event completion
   - Updated automated event generation requirements
   - Added calendar integration details
   - Identified Phase 1 implementation priorities

The updated specifications now include concrete implementation plans for the three workflows you want to focus on initially.

## Summary of Accomplishments

1. **Animal Model Specification**:
   - Defined core fields including tag, gender, reproductive status, etc.
   - Updated category field to use "calf" instead of "baby"
   - Added lastHeatDay field for reproductive tracking

2. **Event Model Specification**:
   - Created comprehensive event model with core fields
   - Defined standard event types with automatic rules
   - Specified calendar display requirements
   - Outlined reminder system logic and implementation notes
