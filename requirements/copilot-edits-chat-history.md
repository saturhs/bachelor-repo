# GitHub Copilot Edits Chat History

## Animal and Event Model Specifications Development

### Initial Query About Animal Model Specifications
**User**: What do you mean by outlining it?

**Copilot**: When the document says "This document outlines the agreed specifications," it means this markdown file provides a structured overview or summary of the key specifications for the Animal model. 

"Outlining" in this context refers to presenting the main structure and components of the Animal model in an organized way, including:

1. The core fields with their types and validation rules
2. Display requirements for the AnimalCard component
3. Data validation rules to be implemented
4. Implementation notes for developers

Rather than being a detailed implementation guide, this document serves as a reference that summarizes the agreed-upon specifications that should be followed when implementing the Animal model throughout the application.

### Adding Age Category Field
**User**: Okay, I forgot to add a field that represents age, I mean if it's adult or a calf

**Copilot**: I see that you actually already have a field for this purpose in your specification. In the Core Fields table, there's a `category` field:

```
| category | String | Age category | Enum: `adult`, `baby` | `adult` |
```

Would you like to modify this field to use "calf" instead of "baby" since this is a dairy farm application? I can update that for you.

*[Copilot suggested the change from "baby" to "calf" in the category field]*

### Adding Last Heat Day Field
**User**: Okay, I forgot also about lastHeatDay field that will be useful for setting up events in future

**Copilot**: *[Added the lastHeatDay field to the Core Fields table]*

### Events Model Overview
**User**: Since we did a plan for animal model, we need to make a plan for events model as well. I prepared a little overview on this concept. Remember that this is only an example, and for example database model fields should be adjusted for purposes of this specific app...

*[User provided a detailed overview of event reminder system requirements]*

**Copilot**: *[Provided a comprehensive event model specification document]*

### Preserving Conversation Context
**User**: Okay, for now I'd like to end work on project, I'll come back tomorrow, but don't want to lose our conversation, there's too much of context. Is there any way to keep it?

**Copilot**: You can preserve our conversation in a few ways:

1. If you're using GitHub Copilot Chat in VSCode, the history of your conversations should be saved automatically in the left sidebar under the chat history.

2. You can also copy-paste the important parts of our conversation into a Markdown file in your project directory for future reference. For example:

```
c:\Users\saturhs\Desktop\bachelor\bachelor-repo\notes\model-specifications-discussion.md
```

3. If you're using GitHub Copilot in the browser, you may want to bookmark this page or export the conversation before closing it.

The two specification files we've worked on (animal-model-specifications.md and event-model-specifications.md) are already saved in your project directory, so the actual design documents are preserved.

When you're ready to continue working tomorrow, you can simply refer back to these specifications and continue building your application.

**User**: I'm using GitHub Copilot Edits, is there a way? Because I can't find history of chats there

**Copilot**: GitHub Copilot Edits doesn't currently have a built-in conversation history feature like GitHub Copilot Chat does. To preserve our conversation and context, I recommend creating a dedicated notes file in your project:

*[Copilot suggested creating a development journal file]*

**User**: Could you save our messages from this chat into copilot-edits-chat-history.md? As you said you can

**Copilot**: *[Saved the conversation history to this file]*
